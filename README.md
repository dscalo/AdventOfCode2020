## Using Go

**Day 17** - I know there is an easier way to solve it,
and probably with way less code! However, it was my first time working with
3d and 4d coordinate systems. There was a lot I had to figure out plus i needed a way to visualize the cubes,
and I wasn't sure I would be able to solve the puzzle in time. 


**Day 19** - I don't know how I did it, but the code I wrote for part 1 automatically worked for part 2!!!!!

**Day 20** - Took me all day to get this one, but I got it without cheating or looking up hints.
 The code is awful, needs a ton of refactoring, but it works and isn't that slow considering all the
loops. so many loops.....

**Day 23** If a mathematical shortcut or formula exists to solve this I couldn't 
find it, so I went with a circular doubly linked list and used a 
lookup table (map[int]*Node) to retrieve a node by its value
