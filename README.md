**Day 17** - I know there is an easier way to solve it,
and probably with way less code! However, it was my first time working with
3d and 4d coordinate systems. There was a lot I had to figure out plus i needed a way to visualize the cubes,
and I wasn't sure I would be able to solve the puzzle in time. 


**Day 19** - I don't know how I did it, but the code I wrote for part 1 automatically worked for part 2!!!!!
